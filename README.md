# BLIP

A remake of the Giulio Ferrari's freeware Blip game originally released in 1998 for Windows 95 and 98.

# Lore
One of the first game sources I had the opportunity to read was a game called Blip, written in Delphi and released as freeware by Giulio Ferrari in 98 (according to [this Internet Archive entry](https://archive.org/details/Blip_1020)).

As a young computer engineering student, it was an awesome experience. I played the game for some time and learned a lot of object-pascal language. I have quite a nice feeling about this remembrance... Thanks, Guilio Ferrari, whoever you are.

Backed by this feeling I decided to rewrite the game and adapt it to a more modern standard. And here we are.
